\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

We conducted an evaluation to assess the effectiveness of our approach. In our evaluation, we address three main research questions:

\begin{itemize}
	
\item\textbf{RQ1}: What are the precision and recall of our approach in identifying API mappings?

\item\textbf{RQ2}: How do the mappings inferred by our approach compare with the human written mappings?

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Subjects}
\label{sub:subject}

We used the API documents of the following two libraries as subjects for our evaluation. 


\textbf{J2ME}. Java Platform, Micro Edition, or Java ME, is a Java platform designed for embedded systems (mobile devices are one kind of such systems). Target devices range from industrial controls to mobile phones (especially feature phones) and set-top boxes. Java ME was formerly known as Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME).

\textbf{Android}.Android is a Linux-based operating system designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers.
