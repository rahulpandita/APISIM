%API documents provide specification information about how to use a particular method within a class by means of method descriptions. However, specifications described in natural Language in API documents are not amenable to formal verification by existing verification tools. 

%Specifications described in natural language in API documents are not amenable to formal verification by existing verification tools. In this paper, we have presented a novel approach for inferring formal specifications from API documents targeted towards code contract generation. Our evaluation results show that our approach has an average of 92\% precision and 93\% recall in identifying sentences describing code contracts from over 2500 sentences. Furthermore, our results also show that our approach has an average of 83.4\% accuracy in inferring specifications from sentences describing code contracts out of over 1600 sentences. 

API mapping across different platforms/languages mappings facilitate machine-based migration
of an application from one API to another.
Thus automated inference of such mappings is highly desirable.
In this paper, we presented \tool : a lightweight text-mining based approach
to infer API mappings.
\tool\ compliments existing mapping inference techniques by leveraging natural language descriptions in API documents instead of relying on existence of manually ported
(or at least functionally similar) code across source and target API's.
We demonstrated the effectiveness of \tool\ by 
comparing the inferred mappings with state-of-the-art code mining based approaches.
Our results indicate that \tool\ is effective in inferring API mappings (from over human-annotated API sentences) with the more than XX accuracy.
