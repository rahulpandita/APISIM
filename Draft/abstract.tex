Mapping across different platform or language Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
is highly desirable.
Among other reasons, mappings facilitate machine-based migration
of an application from one API to another.
Such translation is particularly relevant in current context as 
developers are increasingly migrating applications to diverse platforms or languages
to attract and retain users across such platforms or languages.
Given a typical platform or language expose a large number of API methods
for developers to reuse,
manually writing these mappings is prohibitively resource-intensive
and may be error prone.
Recently, researchers proposed to automate the process by mining API mappings from existing codebases.
However, these approaches rely on existence of manually ported (or at least functionally similar) code across source and target API's.
To address the shortcoming, in this paper we propose \tool: \textbf{\underline{t}}ext \textbf{\underline{m}}ining
based approach to infer \textbf{\underline{AP}}I mappings from the textual description present in API documents.
To evaluate our approach, we apply \tool\ to infer API mappings across: 1) \CodeIn{Java} and \CodeIn{C\# API}, 2) \CodeIn{J2ME} and \CodeIn{Android} API.
We next compare the inferred mappings with state-of-the-art code mining based approaches.
Our results indicate that \tool\ is effective in inferring API mappings with the more than XX accuracy.
