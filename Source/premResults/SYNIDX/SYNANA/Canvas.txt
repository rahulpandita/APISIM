Canvas
Constructs a new Canvas object
	0:	android.graphics.Canvas public Canvas () Construct an empty raster canvas. Use setBitmap() to specify a bitmap to draw into. The initial target density is DENSITY_NONE; this will typically be replaced when a target bitmap is set for the canvas.
	1:	android.graphics.Canvas public Canvas (Bitmap bitmap) Construct a canvas with the specified bitmap to draw into. The bitmap must be mutable. The initial target density of the canvas is the same as the given bitmap's density. Parameters bitmap Specifies a mutable bitmap for the canvas to draw into.
	2:	android.graphics.Canvas public boolean quickReject (float left, float top, float right, float bottom, Canvas.EdgeType type) Return true if the specified rectangle, after being transformed by the current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and therefore you can skip making the draw calls). Parameters left The left side of the rectangle to compare with the current clip top The top of the rectangle to compare with the current clip right The right side of the rectangle to compare with the current clip bottom The bottom of the rectangle to compare with the current clip type AA if the path should be considered antialiased, since that means it may affect a larger area (more pixels) than non-antialiased (BW). Returns true if the rect (transformed by the canvas' matrix) does not intersect with the canvas' clip
	3:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawBitmap (Bitmap bitmap, float left, float top, Paint paint) Draw the specified bitmap, with its top/left corner at (x,y), using the specified paint, transformed by the current matrix. Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be the edge color replicated. If the bitmap and canvas have different densities, this function will take care of automatically scaling the bitmap to draw at the same density as the canvas. Parameters bitmap The bitmap to be drawn left The position of the left side of the bitmap being drawn top The position of the top side of the bitmap being drawn paint The paint used to draw the bitmap (may be null)
	4:	android.graphics.Canvas public int saveLayer (float left, float top, float right, float bottom, Paint paint, int saveFlags) Helper version of saveLayer() that takes 4 values rather than a RectF.
	5:	android.graphics.Canvas public int saveLayerAlpha (float left, float top, float right, float bottom, int alpha, int saveFlags) Helper for saveLayerAlpha() that takes 4 values instead of a RectF.
	6:	android.graphics.Canvas public boolean clipRect (int left, int top, int right, int bottom) Intersect the current clip with the specified rectangle, which is expressed in local coordinates. Parameters left The left side of the rectangle to intersect with the current clip top The top of the rectangle to intersect with the current clip right The right side of the rectangle to intersect with the current clip bottom The bottom of the rectangle to intersect with the current clip Returns true if the resulting clip is non-empty

Parameters left The left side of the rectangle to intersect with the current clip top The top of the rectangle to intersect with the current clip right The right side of the rectangle to intersect with the current clip bottom The bottom of the rectangle to intersect with the current clip op How the clip is modified Returns true if the resulting clip is non-empty
	9:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawRect (float left, float top, float right, float bottom, Paint paint) Draw the specified Rect using the specified paint. The rectangle will be filled or framed based on the Style in the paint. Parameters left The left side of the rectangle to be drawn top The top side of the rectangle to be drawn right The right side of the rectangle to be drawn bottom The bottom side of the rectangle to be drawn paint The paint used to draw the rect
isDoubleBuffered
Checks if the Canvas is double buffered by the implementation
	0:	android.graphics.Canvas public Canvas () Construct an empty raster canvas. Use setBitmap() to specify a bitmap to draw into. The initial target density is DENSITY_NONE; this will typically be replaced when a target bitmap is set for the canvas.
	1:	android.graphics.Canvas public void setBitmap (Bitmap bitmap) Specify a bitmap for the canvas to draw into. All canvas state such as layers, filters, and the save/restore stack are reset with the exception of the current matrix and clip stack. Additionally, as a side-effect the canvas' target density is updated to match that of the bitmap. Parameters bitmap Specifies a mutable bitmap for the canvas to draw into. See Also setDensity(int) getDensity()
	2:	android.graphics.Canvas public Canvas (Bitmap bitmap) Construct a canvas with the specified bitmap to draw into. The bitmap must be mutable. The initial target density of the canvas is the same as the given bitmap's density. Parameters bitmap Specifies a mutable bitmap for the canvas to draw into.
	3:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawPicture (Picture picture) Save the canvas state, draw the picture, and restore the canvas state. This differs from picture.draw(canvas), which does not perform any save/restore. Note: This forces the picture to internally call endRecording() in order to prepare for playback. Parameters picture The picture to be drawn
	4:	android.graphics.Canvas public int getDensity () Returns the target density of the canvas. The default density is derived from the density of its backing bitmap, or DENSITY_NONE if there is not one. Returns Returns the current target density of the canvas, which is used to determine the scaling factor when drawing a bitmap into it. See Also setDensity(int) getDensity()
	5:	android.graphics.Canvas public boolean quickReject (RectF rect, Canvas.EdgeType type) Return true if the specified rectangle, after being transformed by the current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and therefore you can skip making the draw calls).

This modifies the target density of the canvas itself, as well as the density of its backing bitmap via Bitmap.setDensity(int). Parameters density The new target density of the canvas, which is used to determine the scaling factor when drawing a bitmap into it. Use DENSITY_NONE to disable bitmap scaling. See Also getDensity() setDensity(int)
	7:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawColor (int color) Fill the entire canvas' bitmap (restricted to the current clip) with the specified color, using srcover porterduff mode. Parameters color the color to draw onto the canvas

Checks if the platform supports pointer press and release events
	0:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawArc (RectF oval, float startAngle, float sweepAngle, boolean useCenter, Paint paint) Draw the specified arc, which will be scaled to fit inside the specified oval. If the start angle is negative or >= 360, the start angle is treated as start angle modulo 360. If the sweep angle is >= 360, then the oval is drawn completely. Note that this differs slightly from SkPath::arcTo, which treats the sweep angle modulo 360. If the sweep angle is negative, the sweep angle is treated as sweep angle modulo 360 The arc is drawn clockwise. An angle of 0 degrees correspond to the geometric angle of 0 degrees (3 o'clock on a watch.) Parameters oval The bounds of oval used to define the shape and size of the arc startAngle Starting angle (in degrees) where the arc begins sweepAngle Sweep angle (in degrees) measured clockwise useCenter If true, include the center of the oval in the arc, and close it if it is being stroked. This will draw a wedge paint The paint used to draw the arc
	1:	android.graphics.Canvas public boolean getClipBounds (Rect bounds) Return the bounds of the current clip (in local coordinates) in the bounds parameter, and return true if it is non-empty. This can be useful in a way similar to quickReject, in that it tells you that drawing outside of these bounds will be clipped out. Parameters bounds Return the clip bounds here. If it is null, ignore it but still return true if the current clip is non-empty. Returns true if the current clip is non-empty.
	2:	android.graphics.Canvas public int save () Saves the current matrix and clip onto a private stack. Subsequent calls to translate,scale,rotate,skew,concat or clipRect,clipPath will all operate as usual, but when the balancing call to restore() is made, those calls will be forgotten, and the settings that existed before the save() will be reinstated. Returns The value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this save()
	3:	android.graphics.Canvas public int save (int saveFlags) Based on saveFlags, can save the current matrix and clip onto a private stack. Subsequent calls to translate,scale,rotate,skew,concat or clipRect,clipPath will all operate as usual, but when the balancing call to restore() is made, those calls will be forgotten, and the settings that existed before the save() will be reinstated. Parameters saveFlags flag bits that specify which parts of the Canvas state to save/restore Returns The value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this save()
	4:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawPoints (float[] pts, int offset, int count, Paint paint) Draw a series of points. Each point is centered at the coordinate specified by pts[], and its diameter is specified by the paint's stroke width (as transformed by the canvas' CTM), with special treatment for a stroke width of 0, which always draws exactly 1 pixel (or at most 4 if antialiasing is enabled). The shape of the point is controlled by the paint's Cap type. The shape is a square, unless the cap type is Round, in which case the shape is a circle. Parameters pts Array of points to draw [x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2 ...] offset Number of values to skip before starting to draw. count The number of values to process, after skipping offset of them. Since one point uses two values, the number of "points" that are drawn is really (count >> 1). paint The paint used to draw the points
	5:	android.graphics.Canvas public boolean quickReject (RectF rect, Canvas.EdgeType type) Return true if the specified rectangle, after being transformed by the current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and therefore you can skip making the draw calls). Parameters rect the rect to compare with the current clip type AA if the path should be considered antialiased, since that means it may affect a larger area (more pixels) than non-antialiased (BW).

	6:	android.graphics.Canvas public boolean quickReject (Path path, Canvas.EdgeType type) Return true if the specified path, after being transformed by the current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and therefore you can skip making the draw calls). Note: for speed it may return false even if the path itself might not intersect the clip (i.e. the bounds of the path intersects, but the path does not). Parameters path The path to compare with the current clip type AA if the path should be considered antialiased, since that means it may affect a larger area (more pixels) than non-antialiased (BW). Returns true if the path (transformed by the canvas' matrix) does not intersect with the canvas' clip
	7:	android.graphics.Canvas public int saveLayerAlpha (RectF bounds, int alpha, int saveFlags) This behaves the same as save(), but in addition it allocates an offscreen bitmap. All drawing calls are directed there, and only when the balancing call to restore() is made is that offscreen transfered to the canvas (or the previous layer). Subsequent calls to translate, scale, rotate, skew, concat or clipRect, clipPath all operate on this copy. When the balancing call to restore() is made, this copy is deleted and the previous matrix/clip state is restored. Parameters bounds The maximum size the offscreen bitmap needs to be (in local coordinates) alpha The alpha to apply to the offscreen when when it is drawn during restore() saveFlags see _SAVE_FLAG constants Returns value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this call

	9:	android.graphics.Canvas public int saveLayer (RectF bounds, Paint paint, int saveFlags) This behaves the same as save(), but in addition it allocates an offscreen bitmap. All drawing calls are directed there, and only when the balancing call to restore() is made is that offscreen transfered to the canvas (or the previous layer). Subsequent calls to translate, scale, rotate, skew, concat or clipRect, clipPath all operate on this copy. When the balancing call to restore() is made, this copy is deleted and the previous matrix/clip state is restored. Parameters bounds May be null. The maximum size the offscreen bitmap needs to be (in local coordinates) paint This is copied, and is applied to the offscreen when restore() is called. saveFlags see _SAVE_FLAG constants Returns value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this save()

	2:	android.graphics.Canvas public void restoreToCount (int saveCount) Efficient way to pop any calls to save() that happened after the save count reached saveCount. It is an error for saveCount to be less than 1.

Parameters saveCount The save level to restore to.
	3:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawLine (float startX, float startY, float stopX, float stopY, Paint paint) Draw a line segment with the specified start and stop x,y coordinates, using the specified paint. Note that since a line is always "framed", the Style is ignored in the paint. Degenerate lines (length is 0) will not be drawn. Parameters startX The x-coordinate of the start point of the line startY The y-coordinate of the start point of the line paint The paint used to draw the line
	4:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawBitmap (Bitmap bitmap, float left, float top, Paint paint) Draw the specified bitmap, with its top/left corner at (x,y), using the specified paint, transformed by the current matrix. Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be the edge color replicated. If the bitmap and canvas have different densities, this function will take care of automatically scaling the bitmap to draw at the same density as the canvas. Parameters bitmap The bitmap to be drawn left The position of the left side of the bitmap being drawn top The position of the top side of the bitmap being drawn paint The paint used to draw the bitmap (may be null)
	5:	android.graphics.Canvas public int save () Saves the current matrix and clip onto a private stack. Subsequent calls to translate,scale,rotate,skew,concat or clipRect,clipPath will all operate as usual, but when the balancing call to restore() is made, those calls will be forgotten, and the settings that existed before the save() will be reinstated. Returns The value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this save()
	6:	android.graphics.Canvas public boolean quickReject (RectF rect, Canvas.EdgeType type) Return true if the specified rectangle, after being transformed by the current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and therefore you can skip making the draw calls). Parameters rect the rect to compare with the current clip type AA if the path should be considered antialiased, since that means it may affect a larger area (more pixels) than non-antialiased (BW).

	7:	android.graphics.Canvas public int saveLayer (float left, float top, float right, float bottom, Paint paint, int saveFlags) Helper version of saveLayer() that takes 4 values rather than a RectF.
	8:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawArc (RectF oval, float startAngle, float sweepAngle, boolean useCenter, Paint paint) Draw the specified arc, which will be scaled to fit inside the specified oval. If the start angle is negative or >= 360, the start angle is treated as start angle modulo 360. If the sweep angle is >= 360, then the oval is drawn completely. Note that this differs slightly from SkPath::arcTo, which treats the sweep angle modulo 360. If the sweep angle is negative, the sweep angle is treated as sweep angle modulo 360 The arc is drawn clockwise. An angle of 0 degrees correspond to the geometric angle of 0 degrees (3 o'clock on a watch.) Parameters oval The bounds of oval used to define the shape and size of the arc startAngle Starting angle (in degrees) where the arc begins sweepAngle Sweep angle (in degrees) measured clockwise useCenter If true, include the center of the oval in the arc, and close it if it is being stroked.

	4:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawPosText (String text, float[] pos, Paint paint) Draw the text in the array, with each character's origin specified by the pos array. This method does not support glyph composition and decomposition and should therefore not be used to render complex scripts. Parameters text The text to be drawn pos Array of [x,y] positions, used to position each character paint The paint used for the text (e.g. color, size, style)
	5:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawTextOnPath (String text, Path path, float hOffset, float vOffset, Paint paint) Draw the text, with origin at (x,y), using the specified paint, along the specified path.

Parameters pts Array of points to draw [x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2 ...] offset Number of values to skip before starting to draw. count The number of values to process, after skipping offset of them. Since one point uses two values, the number of "points" that are drawn is really (count >> 1). paint The paint used to draw the points
	8:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawLines (float[] pts, int offset, int count, Paint paint) Draw a series of lines. Each line is taken from 4 consecutive values in the pts array. Thus to draw 1 line, the array must contain at least 4 values.

	4:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawPicture (Picture picture) Save the canvas state, draw the picture, and restore the canvas state. This differs from picture.draw(canvas), which does not perform any save/restore. Note: This forces the picture to internally call endRecording() in order to prepare for playback. Parameters picture The picture to be drawn
	5:	android.graphics.Canvas public void restoreToCount (int saveCount) Efficient way to pop any calls to save() that happened after the save count reached saveCount.

	6:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawBitmap (Bitmap bitmap, float left, float top, Paint paint) Draw the specified bitmap, with its top/left corner at (x,y), using the specified paint, transformed by the current matrix. Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be the edge color replicated.

Parameters pts Array of points to draw [x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2 ...] offset Number of values to skip before starting to draw. count The number of values to process, after skipping offset of them. Since one point uses two values, the number of "points" that are drawn is really (count >> 1). paint The paint used to draw the points
	2:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawLine (float startX, float startY, float stopX, float stopY, Paint paint) Draw a line segment with the specified start and stop x,y coordinates, using the specified paint.

	3:	android.graphics.Canvas public int saveLayer (RectF bounds, Paint paint, int saveFlags) This behaves the same as save(), but in addition it allocates an offscreen bitmap. All drawing calls are directed there, and only when the balancing call to restore() is made is that offscreen transfered to the canvas (or the previous layer). Subsequent calls to translate, scale, rotate, skew, concat or clipRect, clipPath all operate on this copy. When the balancing call to restore() is made, this copy is deleted and the previous matrix/clip state is restored. Parameters bounds May be null. The maximum size the offscreen bitmap needs to be (in local coordinates) paint This is copied, and is applied to the offscreen when restore() is called. saveFlags see _SAVE_FLAG constants Returns value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this save()

	7:	android.graphics.Canvas public int saveLayer (float left, float top, float right, float bottom, Paint paint, int saveFlags) Helper version of saveLayer() that takes 4 values rather than a RectF.
	8:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawBitmap (Bitmap bitmap, Rect src, RectF dst, Paint paint) Draw the specified bitmap, scaling/translating automatically to fill the destination rectangle. If the source rectangle is not null, it specifies the subset of the bitmap to draw. Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be the edge color replicated. This function ignores the density associated with the bitmap. This is because the source and destination rectangle coordinate spaces are in their respective densities, so must already have the appropriate scaling factor applied. Parameters bitmap The bitmap to be drawn src May be null. The subset of the bitmap to be drawn dst The rectangle that the bitmap will be scaled/translated to fit into paint May be null. The paint used to draw the bitmap

There are meshWidth+1 vertices across, and meshHeight+1 vertices down. The verts array is accessed in row-major order, so that the first meshWidth+1 vertices are distributed across the top of the bitmap from left to right. A more general version of this method is drawVertices(). Parameters bitmap The bitmap to draw using the mesh meshWidth The number of columns in the mesh. Nothing is drawn if this is 0 meshHeight The number of rows in the mesh. Nothing is drawn if this is 0 verts Array of x,y pairs, specifying where the mesh should be drawn.

Parameters saveFlags flag bits that specify which parts of the Canvas state to save/restore Returns The value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this save()
	3:	android.graphics.Canvas public Canvas () Construct an empty raster canvas. Use setBitmap() to specify a bitmap to draw into. The initial target density is DENSITY_NONE; this will typically be replaced when a target bitmap is set for the canvas.

	8:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawPoints (float[] pts, int offset, int count, Paint paint) Draw a series of points. Each point is centered at the coordinate specified by pts[], and its diameter is specified by the paint's stroke width (as transformed by the canvas' CTM), with special treatment for a stroke width of 0, which always draws exactly 1 pixel (or at most 4 if antialiasing is enabled).

Parameters saveCount The save level to restore to.
	1:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawPicture (Picture picture) Save the canvas state, draw the picture, and restore the canvas state.

Parameters picture The picture to be drawn
	2:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawBitmapMesh (Bitmap bitmap, int meshWidth, int meshHeight, float[] verts, int vertOffset, int[] colors, int colorOffset, Paint paint) Draw the bitmap through the mesh, where mesh vertices are evenly distributed across the bitmap. There are meshWidth+1 vertices across, and meshHeight+1 vertices down. The verts array is accessed in row-major order, so that the first meshWidth+1 vertices are distributed across the top of the bitmap from left to right. A more general version of this method is drawVertices(). Parameters bitmap The bitmap to draw using the mesh meshWidth The number of columns in the mesh. Nothing is drawn if this is 0 meshHeight The number of rows in the mesh. Nothing is drawn if this is 0 verts Array of x,y pairs, specifying where the mesh should be drawn.

	6:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawBitmap (Bitmap bitmap, float left, float top, Paint paint) Draw the specified bitmap, with its top/left corner at (x,y), using the specified paint, transformed by the current matrix. Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be the edge color replicated. If the bitmap and canvas have different densities, this function will take care of automatically scaling the bitmap to draw at the same density as the canvas. Parameters bitmap The bitmap to be drawn left The position of the left side of the bitmap being drawn top The position of the top side of the bitmap being drawn paint The paint used to draw the bitmap (may be null)
	7:	android.graphics.Canvas public boolean getClipBounds (Rect bounds) Return the bounds of the current clip (in local coordinates) in the bounds parameter, and return true if it is non-empty.

	5:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawOval (RectF oval, Paint paint) Draw the specified oval using the specified paint. The oval will be filled or framed based on the Style in the paint. Parameters oval The rectangle bounds of the oval to be drawn
	6:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawPoints (float[] pts, Paint paint) Helper for drawPoints() that assumes you want to draw the entire array
	7:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawBitmap (Bitmap bitmap, float left, float top, Paint paint) Draw the specified bitmap, with its top/left corner at (x,y), using the specified paint, transformed by the current matrix. Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be the edge color replicated. If the bitmap and canvas have different densities, this function will take care of automatically scaling the bitmap to draw at the same density as the canvas. Parameters bitmap The bitmap to be drawn left The position of the left side of the bitmap being drawn top The position of the top side of the bitmap being drawn paint The paint used to draw the bitmap (may be null)
	8:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawPoints (float[] pts, int offset, int count, Paint paint) Draw a series of points. Each point is centered at the coordinate specified by pts[], and its diameter is specified by the paint's stroke width (as transformed by the canvas' CTM), with special treatment for a stroke width of 0, which always draws exactly 1 pixel (or at most 4 if antialiasing is enabled). The shape of the point is controlled by the paint's Cap type. The shape is a square, unless the cap type is Round, in which case the shape is a circle. Parameters pts Array of points to draw [x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2 ...] offset Number of values to skip before starting to draw. count The number of values to process, after skipping offset of them. Since one point uses two values, the number of "points" that are drawn is really (count >> 1). paint The paint used to draw the points
	9:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawBitmap (Bitmap bitmap, Matrix matrix, Paint paint) Draw the bitmap using the specified matrix. Parameters bitmap The bitmap to draw matrix The matrix used to transform the bitmap when it is drawn paint May be null. The paint used to draw the bitmap
sizeChanged
Called when the drawable area of the Canvas has been changed
	0:	android.graphics.Canvas public Canvas () Construct an empty raster canvas. Use setBitmap() to specify a bitmap to draw into. The initial target density is DENSITY_NONE; this will typically be replaced when a target bitmap is set for the canvas.
	1:	android.graphics.Canvas public Canvas (Bitmap bitmap) Construct a canvas with the specified bitmap to draw into. The bitmap must be mutable. The initial target density of the canvas is the same as the given bitmap's density. Parameters bitmap Specifies a mutable bitmap for the canvas to draw into.
	2:	android.graphics.Canvas public void setDensity (int density) Specifies the density for this Canvas' backing bitmap. This modifies the target density of the canvas itself, as well as the density of its backing bitmap via Bitmap.setDensity(int). Parameters density The new target density of the canvas, which is used to determine the scaling factor when drawing a bitmap into it. Use DENSITY_NONE to disable bitmap scaling. See Also getDensity() setDensity(int)
	3:	android.graphics.Canvas public int getDensity () Returns the target density of the canvas. The default density is derived from the density of its backing bitmap, or DENSITY_NONE if there is not one. Returns Returns the current target density of the canvas, which is used to determine the scaling factor when drawing a bitmap into it. See Also setDensity(int) getDensity()
	4:	android.graphics.Canvas public void setBitmap (Bitmap bitmap) Specify a bitmap for the canvas to draw into. All canvas state such as layers, filters, and the save/restore stack are reset with the exception of the current matrix and clip stack. Additionally, as a side-effect the canvas' target density is updated to match that of the bitmap. Parameters bitmap Specifies a mutable bitmap for the canvas to draw into. See Also setDensity(int) getDensity()
	5:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawRGB (int r, int g, int b) Fill the entire canvas' bitmap (restricted to the current clip) with the specified RGB color, using srcover porterduff mode. Parameters r red component (0..255) of the color to draw onto the canvas g green component (0..255) of the color to draw onto the canvas b blue component (0..255) of the color to draw onto the canvas
	6:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawPicture (Picture picture) Save the canvas state, draw the picture, and restore the canvas state. This differs from picture.draw(canvas), which does not perform any save/restore. Note: This forces the picture to internally call endRecording() in order to prepare for playback. Parameters picture The picture to be drawn
	7:	android.graphics.Canvas public boolean quickReject (RectF rect, Canvas.EdgeType type) Return true if the specified rectangle, after being transformed by the current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and therefore you can skip making the draw calls). Parameters rect the rect to compare with the current clip type AA if the path should be considered antialiased, since that means it may affect a larger area (more pixels) than non-antialiased (BW). Returns true if the rect (transformed by the canvas' matrix) does not intersect with the canvas' clip
	8:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawARGB (int a, int r, int g, int b) Fill the entire canvas' bitmap (restricted to the current clip) with the specified ARGB color, using srcover porterduff mode. Parameters a alpha component (0..255) of the color to draw onto the canvas r red component (0..255) of the color to draw onto the canvas g green component (0..255) of the color to draw onto the canvas b blue component (0..255) of the color to draw onto the canvas
	9:	android.graphics.Canvas public boolean quickReject (float left, float top, float right, float bottom, Canvas.EdgeType type) Return true if the specified rectangle, after being transformed by the current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and therefore you can skip making the draw calls). Parameters left The left side of the rectangle to compare with the current clip top The top of the rectangle to compare with the current clip right The right side of the rectangle to compare with the current clip bottom The bottom of the rectangle to compare with the current clip type AA if the path should be considered antialiased, since that means it may affect a larger area (more pixels) than non-antialiased (BW). Returns true if the rect (transformed by the canvas' matrix) does not intersect with the canvas' clip
