Canvas
Constructs a new Canvas object
	0:	android.graphics.Canvas public Canvas () Construct an empty raster canvas. Use setBitmap() to specify a bitmap to draw into. The initial target density is DENSITY_NONE; this will typically be replaced when a target bitmap is set for the canvas.
	1:	android.graphics.Canvas public Canvas (Bitmap bitmap) Construct a canvas with the specified bitmap to draw into. The bitmap must be mutable. The initial target density of the canvas is the same as the given bitmap's density. Parameters bitmap Specifies a mutable bitmap for the canvas to draw into.
	2:	android.graphics.Canvas public final Matrix getMatrix () Return a new matrix with a copy of the canvas' current transformation matrix.
	3:	android.graphics.Canvas public void setDensity (int density) Specifies the density for this Canvas' backing bitmap. This modifies the target density of the canvas itself, as well as the density of its backing bitmap via Bitmap.setDensity(int). Parameters density The new target density of the canvas, which is used to determine the scaling factor when drawing a bitmap into it. Use DENSITY_NONE to disable bitmap scaling. See Also getDensity() setDensity(int)

There are meshWidth+1 vertices across, and meshHeight+1 vertices down. The verts array is accessed in row-major order, so that the first meshWidth+1 vertices are distributed across the top of the bitmap from left to right.

	1:	android.graphics.Canvas public boolean quickReject (RectF rect, Canvas.EdgeType type) Return true if the specified rectangle, after being transformed by the current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and therefore you can skip making the draw calls). Parameters rect the rect to compare with the current clip type AA if the path should be considered antialiased, since that means it may affect a larger area (more pixels) than non-antialiased (BW). Returns true if the rect (transformed by the canvas' matrix) does not intersect with the canvas' clip
	2:	android.graphics.Canvas public boolean quickReject (Path path, Canvas.EdgeType type) Return true if the specified path, after being transformed by the current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and therefore you can skip making the draw calls).

	4:	android.graphics.Canvas public int save (int saveFlags) Based on saveFlags, can save the current matrix and clip onto a private stack. Subsequent calls to translate,scale,rotate,skew,concat or clipRect,clipPath will all operate as usual, but when the balancing call to restore() is made, those calls will be forgotten, and the settings that existed before the save() will be reinstated. Parameters saveFlags flag bits that specify which parts of the Canvas state to save/restore Returns The value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this save()
	5:	android.graphics.Canvas public Canvas () Construct an empty raster canvas. Use setBitmap() to specify a bitmap to draw into. The initial target density is DENSITY_NONE; this will typically be replaced when a target bitmap is set for the canvas.
	6:	android.graphics.Canvas public int saveLayerAlpha (RectF bounds, int alpha, int saveFlags) This behaves the same as save(), but in addition it allocates an offscreen bitmap. All drawing calls are directed there, and only when the balancing call to restore() is made is that offscreen transfered to the canvas (or the previous layer). Subsequent calls to translate, scale, rotate, skew, concat or clipRect, clipPath all operate on this copy. When the balancing call to restore() is made, this copy is deleted and the previous matrix/clip state is restored. Parameters bounds The maximum size the offscreen bitmap needs to be (in local coordinates) alpha The alpha to apply to the offscreen when when it is drawn during restore() saveFlags see _SAVE_FLAG constants Returns value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this call
	7:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawBitmap (Bitmap bitmap, Rect src, RectF dst, Paint paint) Draw the specified bitmap, scaling/translating automatically to fill the destination rectangle. If the source rectangle is not null, it specifies the subset of the bitmap to draw. Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be the edge color replicated. This function ignores the density associated with the bitmap. This is because the source and destination rectangle coordinate spaces are in their respective densities, so must already have the appropriate scaling factor applied. Parameters bitmap The bitmap to be drawn src May be null. The subset of the bitmap to be drawn dst The rectangle that the bitmap will be scaled/translated to fit into paint May be null. The paint used to draw the bitmap
	8:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawBitmap (Bitmap bitmap, float left, float top, Paint paint) Draw the specified bitmap, with its top/left corner at (x,y), using the specified paint, transformed by the current matrix. Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be the edge color replicated. If the bitmap and canvas have different densities, this function will take care of automatically scaling the bitmap to draw at the same density as the canvas. Parameters bitmap The bitmap to be drawn left The position of the left side of the bitmap being drawn top The position of the top side of the bitmap being drawn paint The paint used to draw the bitmap (may be null)
	9:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawBitmap (Bitmap bitmap, Rect src, Rect dst, Paint paint) Draw the specified bitmap, scaling/translating automatically to fill the destination rectangle. If the source rectangle is not null, it specifies the subset of the bitmap to draw. Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be the edge color replicated. This function ignores the density associated with the bitmap. This is because the source and destination rectangle coordinate spaces are in their respective densities, so must already have the appropriate scaling factor applied. Parameters bitmap The bitmap to be drawn src May be null. The subset of the bitmap to be drawn dst The rectangle that the bitmap will be scaled/translated to fit into paint May be null. The paint used to draw the bitmap
getKeyCode

	0:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawVertices (Canvas.VertexMode mode, int vertexCount, float[] verts, int vertOffset, float[] texs, int texOffset, int[] colors, int colorOffset, short[] indices, int indexOffset, int indexCount, Paint paint) Draw the array of vertices, interpreted as triangles (based on mode). The verts array is required, and specifies the x,y pairs for each vertex. If texs is non-null, then it is used to specify the coordinate in shader coordinates to use at each vertex (the paint must have a shader in this case). If there is no texs array, but there is a color array, then each color is interpolated across its corresponding triangle in a gradient. If both texs and colors arrays are present, then they behave as before, but the resulting color at each pixels is the result of multiplying the colors from the shader and the color-gradient together. The indices array is optional, but if it is present, then it is used to specify the index of each triangle, rather than just walking through the arrays in order. Parameters mode How to interpret the array of vertices vertexCount The number of values in the vertices array (and corresponding texs and colors arrays if non-null). Each logical vertex is two values (x, y), vertexCount must be a multiple of 2. verts Array of vertices for the mesh vertOffset Number of values in the verts to skip before drawing. texs May be null. If not null, specifies the coordinates to sample into the current shader (e.g. bitmap tile or gradient) texOffset Number of values in texs to skip before drawing. colors May be null. If not null, specifies a color for each vertex, to be interpolated across the triangle. colorOffset Number of values in colors to skip before drawing. indices If not null, array of indices to reference into the vertex (texs, colors) array. indexCount number of entries in the indices array (if not null). paint Specifies the shader to use if the texs array is non-null.
	1:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawArc (RectF oval, float startAngle, float sweepAngle, boolean useCenter, Paint paint) Draw the specified arc, which will be scaled to fit inside the specified oval. If the start angle is negative or >= 360, the start angle is treated as start angle modulo 360. If the sweep angle is >= 360, then the oval is drawn completely. Note that this differs slightly from SkPath::arcTo, which treats the sweep angle modulo 360. If the sweep angle is negative, the sweep angle is treated as sweep angle modulo 360 The arc is drawn clockwise. An angle of 0 degrees correspond to the geometric angle of 0 degrees (3 o'clock on a watch.) Parameters oval The bounds of oval used to define the shape and size of the arc startAngle Starting angle (in degrees) where the arc begins sweepAngle Sweep angle (in degrees) measured clockwise useCenter If true, include the center of the oval in the arc, and close it if it is being stroked. This will draw a wedge paint The paint used to draw the arc
	2:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawBitmapMesh (Bitmap bitmap, int meshWidth, int meshHeight, float[] verts, int vertOffset, int[] colors, int colorOffset, Paint paint) Draw the bitmap through the mesh, where mesh vertices are evenly distributed across the bitmap. There are meshWidth+1 vertices across, and meshHeight+1 vertices down. The verts array is accessed in row-major order, so that the first meshWidth+1 vertices are distributed across the top of the bitmap from left to right.

	0:	android.graphics.Canvas public boolean isOpaque () Return true if the device that the current layer draws into is opaque (i.e. does not support per-pixel alpha). Returns true if the device that the current layer draws into is opaque
	1:	android.graphics.Canvas public Canvas (Bitmap bitmap) Construct a canvas with the specified bitmap to draw into. The bitmap must be mutable. The initial target density of the canvas is the same as the given bitmap's density. Parameters bitmap Specifies a mutable bitmap for the canvas to draw into.
	2:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawBitmap (Bitmap bitmap, Rect src, RectF dst, Paint paint) Draw the specified bitmap, scaling/translating automatically to fill the destination rectangle. If the source rectangle is not null, it specifies the subset of the bitmap to draw. Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be the edge color replicated. This function ignores the density associated with the bitmap. This is because the source and destination rectangle coordinate spaces are in their respective densities, so must already have the appropriate scaling factor applied. Parameters bitmap The bitmap to be drawn src May be null. The subset of the bitmap to be drawn dst The rectangle that the bitmap will be scaled/translated to fit into paint May be null. The paint used to draw the bitmap

Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be the edge color replicated. If the bitmap and canvas have different densities, this function will take care of automatically scaling the bitmap to draw at the same density as the canvas. Parameters bitmap The bitmap to be drawn left The position of the left side of the bitmap being drawn top The position of the top side of the bitmap being drawn paint The paint used to draw the bitmap (may be null)
