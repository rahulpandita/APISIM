drawString
(x,y)	0:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public void drawString(String str, int x, int y, int anchor) Draws the specified String using the current font and color. The x,y position is the position of the anchor point. See anchor points. Parameters: str - the String to be drawn x - the x coordinate of the anchor point y - the y coordinate of the anchor point anchor - the anchor point for positioning the text Throws: NullPointerException - if str is null IllegalArgumentException - if anchor is not a legal value See Also: drawChars(char[], int, int, int, int, int)

(LEFT, HCENTER, RIGHT)
(TOP, BASELINE, BOTTOM)
OR
TOP | LEFT

Vertical centering of the text is not specified since it is not considered useful, it is hard to specify, and it is burdensome to implement. Thus, the VCENTER value is not allowed in the anchor point parameter of text drawing calls.
The actual position of the bounding box of the text relative to the (x, y) location is determined by the anchor point. These anchor points occur at named locations along the outer edge of the bounding box. Thus, if f is g's current font (as returned by g.getFont(), the following calls will all have identical results:
g.drawString(str, x, y, TOP|LEFT);
    g.drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str)/2, y, TOP|HCENTER);
    g.drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str), y, TOP|RIGHT);

    g.drawString(str, x,
        y + f.getBaselinePosition(), BASELINE|LEFT);
    g.drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str)/2,
        y + f.getBaselinePosition(), BASELINE|HCENTER);
    g.drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str),
        y + f.getBaselinePosition(), BASELINE|RIGHT);

    drawString(str, x,
        y + f.getHeight(), BOTTOM|LEFT);
    drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str)/2,
        y + f.getHeight(), BOTTOM|HCENTER);
    drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str),
        y + f.getHeight(), BOTTOM|RIGHT);
For text drawing, the inter-character and inter-line spacing (leading) specified by the font designer are included as part of the values returned in the stringWidth() and getHeight() calls of class Font. For example, given the following code:
// (5)
    g.drawString(string1+string2, x, y, TOP|LEFT);

    // (6)
    g.drawString(string1, x, y, TOP|LEFT);
    g.drawString(string2, x + f.stringWidth(string1), y, TOP|LEFT);

Code fragments (5) and (6) behave similarly if not identically. This occurs because f.stringWidth() includes the inter-character spacing. The exact spacing of may differ between these calls if the system supports font kerning.
Similarly, reasonable vertical spacing may be achieved simply by adding the font height to the Y-position of subsequent lines. For example:
g.drawString(string1, x, y, TOP|LEFT);
    g.drawString(string2, x, y + f.fontHeight(), TOP|LEFT);
draws string1 and string2 on separate lines with an appropriate amount of inter-line spacing.
The stringWidth() of the string and the fontHeight() of the font in which it is drawn define the size of the bounding box of a piece of text. As described above, this box includes inter-line and inter-character spacing. The implementation is required to put this space below and to right of the pixels actually belonging to the characters drawn. Applications that wish to position graphics closely with respect to text (for example, to paint a rectangle around a string of text) may assume that there is space below and to the right of a string and that there is no space above and to the left of the string.
Anchor points are also used for positioning of images. Similar to text drawing, the anchor point for an image specifies the point on the bounding rectangle of the destination that is to positioned at the (x,y) location given in the graphics request. Unlike text, vertical centering of images is well-defined, and thus the VCENTER value may be used within the anchor point parameter of image drawing requests. Because images have no notion of a baseline, the BASELINE value may not be used within the anchor point parameter of image drawing requests.

The origin is interpreted based on the Align setting in the paint. Parameters text The text to be drawn x The x-coordinate of the origin of the text being drawn y The y-coordinate of the origin of the text being drawn paint The paint used for the text (e.g. color, size, style)

Parameters origin The root view of the screen. view The view. x The expected x coordinate. y The expected y coordinate.
	6:	javax.microedition.lcdui.game.LayerManager public void paint(Graphics g, int x, int y) Renders the LayerManager's current view window at the specified location. The LayerManager renders each of its layers in order of descending index, thereby implementing the correct z-order. Layers that are completely outside of the view window are not rendered. The coordinates passed to this method determine where the LayerManager's view window will be rendered relative to the origin of the Graphics object. For example, a game may use the top of the screen to display the current score, so to render the game's layers below that area, the view window might be rendered at (0, 20). The location is relative to the Graphics object's origin, so translating the Graphics object will change where the view window is rendered on the screen. The clip region of the Graphics object is intersected with a region having the same dimensions as the view window and located at (x,y). The LayerManager then translates the graphics object such that the point (x,y) corresponds to the location of the viewWindow in the coordinate system of the LayerManager. The Layers are then rendered in the appropriate order. The translation and clip region of the Graphics object are restored to their prior values before this method returns. Rendering is subject to the clip region and translation of the Graphics object. Thus, only part of the specified view window may be rendered if the clip region is not large enough. For performance reasons, this method may ignore Layers that are invisible or that would be rendered entirely outside of the Graphics object's clip region. The attributes of the Graphics object are not restored to a known state between calls to the Layers' paint methods. The clip region may extend beyond the bounds of a Layer; it is the responsibility of the Layer to ensure that rendering operations are performed within its bounds. Parameters: g - the graphics instance with which to draw the LayerManager x - the horizontal location at which to render the view window, relative to the Graphics' translated origin y - the vertical location at which to render the view window, relative to the Graphics' translated origin Throws: NullPointerException - if g is null See Also: setViewWindow(int, int, int, int)

For example, calling translate(1, 2) and then translate(3, 4) results in a translation of (4, 6). The application can set an absolute origin (ax, ay) using the following technique: g.translate(ax - g.getTranslateX(), ay - g.getTranslateY()) Parameters: x - the x coordinate of the new translation origin y - the y coordinate of the new translation origin See Also: getTranslateX(), getTranslateY()

setFont
Sets the font for all subsequent text rendering operations	0:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public void setFont(Font font) Sets the font for all subsequent text rendering operations. If font is null, it is equivalent to setFont(Font.getDefaultFont()). Parameters: font - the specified font See Also: Font, getFont(), drawString(java.lang.String, int, int, int), drawChars(char[], int, int, int, int, int)

	1:	javax.microedition.lcdui.StringItem public void setFont(Font font) Sets the application's preferred font for rendering this StringItem. The font is a hint, and the implementation may disregard the application's preferred font. The font parameter must be a valid Font object or null. If the font parameter is null, the implementation must use its default font to render the StringItem. Parameters: font - the preferred font to use to render this StringItem Since: MIDP 2.0 See Also: getFont()

	2:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Choice public void setFont(int elementNum, Font font) Sets the application's preferred font for rendering the specified element of this Choice. An element's font is a hint, and the implementation may disregard the application's preferred font. The elementNum parameter must be within the range [0..size()-1], inclusive. The font parameter must be a valid Font object or null. If the font parameter is null, the implementation must use its default font to render the element. Parameters: elementNum - the index of the element, starting from zero font - the preferred font to use to render the element Throws: IndexOutOfBoundsException - if elementNum is invalid Since: MIDP 2.0 See Also: getFont(int)

	3:	javax.microedition.lcdui.ChoiceGroup public void setFont(int elementNum, Font font) Sets the application's preferred font for rendering the specified element of this Choice. An element's font is a hint, and the implementation may disregard the application's preferred font. The elementNum parameter must be within the range [0..size()-1], inclusive. The font parameter must be a valid Font object or null. If the font parameter is null, the implementation must use its default font to render the element. Specified by: setFont in interface Choice Parameters: elementNum - the index of the element, starting from zero font - the preferred font to use to render the element Throws: IndexOutOfBoundsException - if elementNum is invalid Since: MIDP 2.0 See Also: getFont(int)

	4:	javax.microedition.lcdui.List public void setFont(int elementNum, Font font) Sets the application's preferred font for rendering the specified element of this Choice. An element's font is a hint, and the implementation may disregard the application's preferred font. The elementNum parameter must be within the range [0..size()-1], inclusive. The font parameter must be a valid Font object or null. If the font parameter is null, the implementation must use its default font to render the element. Specified by: setFont in interface Choice Parameters: elementNum - the index of the element, starting from zero font - the preferred font to use to render the element Throws: IndexOutOfBoundsException - if elementNum is invalid Since: MIDP 2.0 See Also: getFont(int)

	5:	android.graphics.Paint public void setTextLocale (Locale locale) Set the text locale. The text locale affects how the text is drawn for some languages. For example, if the locale is CHINESE or CHINA, then the text renderer will prefer to draw text using a Chinese font. Likewise, if the locale is JAPANESE or JAPAN, then the text renderer will prefer to draw text using a Japanese font. This distinction is important because Chinese and Japanese text both use many of the same Unicode code points but their appearance is subtly different for each language. By default, the text locale is initialized to the system locale (as returned by getDefault()). This assumes that the text to be rendered will most likely be in the user's preferred language. If the actual language of the text is known, then it can be provided to the text renderer using this method. The text renderer may attempt to guess the language script based on the contents of the text to be drawn independent of the text locale here. Specifying the text locale just helps it do a better job in certain ambiguous cases Parameters locale the paint's locale value for drawing text, must not be null.
	6:	android.text.Layout protected Layout (CharSequence text, TextPaint paint, int width, Layout.Alignment align, float spacingMult, float spacingAdd) Subclasses of Layout use this constructor to set the display text, width, and other standard properties. Parameters text the text to render paint the default paint for the layout. Styles can override various attributes of the paint. width the wrapping width for the text. align whether to left, right, or center the text.

	9:	android.graphics.Canvas public int save () Saves the current matrix and clip onto a private stack. Subsequent calls to translate,scale,rotate,skew,concat or clipRect,clipPath will all operate as usual, but when the balancing call to restore() is made, those calls will be forgotten, and the settings that existed before the save() will be reinstated. Returns The value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this save()
getClipX
Gets the X offset of the current clipping area, relative to the coordinate system origin of this graphics context	0:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public int getClipX() Gets the X offset of the current clipping area, relative to the coordinate system origin of this graphics context. Separating the getClip operation into two methods returning integers is more performance and memory efficient than one getClip() call returning an object. Returns: X offset of the current clipping area See Also: clipRect(int, int, int, int), setClip(int, int, int, int)

	1:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public int getClipY() Gets the Y offset of the current clipping area, relative to the coordinate system origin of this graphics context. Separating the getClip operation into two methods returning integers is more performance and memory efficient than one getClip() call returning an object. Returns: Y offset of the current clipping area See Also: clipRect(int, int, int, int), setClip(int, int, int, int)

	2:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public int getTranslateX() Gets the X coordinate of the translated origin of this graphics context. Returns: X of current origin

	3:	javax.microedition.lcdui.game.LayerManager public void paint(Graphics g, int x, int y) Renders the LayerManager's current view window at the specified location. The LayerManager renders each of its layers in order of descending index, thereby implementing the correct z-order. Layers that are completely outside of the view window are not rendered. The coordinates passed to this method determine where the LayerManager's view window will be rendered relative to the origin of the Graphics object. For example, a game may use the top of the screen to display the current score, so to render the game's layers below that area, the view window might be rendered at (0, 20). The location is relative to the Graphics object's origin, so translating the Graphics object will change where the view window is rendered on the screen. The clip region of the Graphics object is intersected with a region having the same dimensions as the view window and located at (x,y). The LayerManager then translates the graphics object such that the point (x,y) corresponds to the location of the viewWindow in the coordinate system of the LayerManager. The Layers are then rendered in the appropriate order. The translation and clip region of the Graphics object are restored to their prior values before this method returns. Rendering is subject to the clip region and translation of the Graphics object. Thus, only part of the specified view window may be rendered if the clip region is not large enough. For performance reasons, this method may ignore Layers that are invisible or that would be rendered entirely outside of the Graphics object's clip region. The attributes of the Graphics object are not restored to a known state between calls to the Layers' paint methods. The clip region may extend beyond the bounds of a Layer; it is the responsibility of the Layer to ensure that rendering operations are performed within its bounds. Parameters: g - the graphics instance with which to draw the LayerManager x - the horizontal location at which to render the view window, relative to the Graphics' translated origin y - the vertical location at which to render the view window, relative to the Graphics' translated origin Throws: NullPointerException - if g is null See Also: setViewWindow(int, int, int, int)

	4:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public void translate(int x, int y) Translates the origin of the graphics context to the point (x, y) in the current coordinate system. All coordinates used in subsequent rendering operations on this graphics context will be relative to this new origin. The effect of calls to translate() are cumulative. For example, calling translate(1, 2) and then translate(3, 4) results in a translation of (4, 6). The application can set an absolute origin (ax, ay) using the following technique: g.translate(ax - g.getTranslateX(), ay - g.getTranslateY()) Parameters: x - the x coordinate of the new translation origin y - the y coordinate of the new translation origin See Also: getTranslateX(), getTranslateY()

	5:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public int getTranslateY() Gets the Y coordinate of the translated origin of this graphics context. Returns: Y of current origin

	6:	android.widget.OverScroller public final int getCurrX () Returns the current X offset in the scroll. Returns The new X offset as an absolute distance from the origin.
	7:	android.widget.Scroller public final int getCurrX () Returns the current X offset in the scroll. Returns The new X offset as an absolute distance from the origin.
	8:	android.support.v4.widget.ScrollerCompat public int getCurrX () Returns the current X offset in the scroll. Returns The new X offset as an absolute distance from the origin.
	9:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public void copyArea(int x_src, int y_src, int width, int height, int x_dest, int y_dest, int anchor) Copies the contents of a rectangular area (x_src, y_src, width, height) to a destination area, whose anchor point identified by anchor is located at (x_dest, y_dest). The effect must be that the destination area contains an exact copy of the contents of the source area immediately prior to the invocation of this method. This result must occur even if the source and destination areas overlap. The points (x_src, y_src) and (x_dest, y_dest) are both specified relative to the coordinate system of the Graphics object. It is illegal for the source region to extend beyond the bounds of the graphic object. This requires that: 
   x_src + tx >= 0
   y_src + ty >= 0
   x_src + tx + width <= width of Graphics object's destination
   y_src + ty + height <= height of Graphics object's destination      where tx and ty represent the X and Y coordinates of the translated origin of this graphics object, as returned by getTranslateX() and getTranslateY(), respectively. However, it is legal for the destination area to extend beyond the bounds of the Graphics object. Pixels outside of the bounds of the Graphics object will not be drawn. The copyArea method is allowed on all Graphics objects except those whose destination is the actual display device. This restriction is necessary because allowing a copyArea method on the display would adversely impact certain techniques for implementing double-buffering. Like other graphics operations, the copyArea method uses the Source Over Destination rule for combining pixels. However, since it is defined only for mutable images, which can contain only fully opaque pixels, this is effectively the same as pixel replacement. Parameters: x_src - the x coordinate of upper left corner of source area y_src - the y coordinate of upper left corner of source area width - the width of the source area height - the height of the source area x_dest - the x coordinate of the destination anchor point y_dest - the y coordinate of the destination anchor point anchor - the anchor point for positioning the region within the destination image Throws: IllegalStateException - if the destination of this Graphics object is the display device IllegalArgumentException - if the region to be copied exceeds the bounds of the source image Since: MIDP 2.0

getClipY
Gets the Y offset of the current clipping area, relative to the coordinate system origin of this graphics context	0:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public int getClipY() Gets the Y offset of the current clipping area, relative to the coordinate system origin of this graphics context. Separating the getClip operation into two methods returning integers is more performance and memory efficient than one getClip() call returning an object. Returns: Y offset of the current clipping area See Also: clipRect(int, int, int, int), setClip(int, int, int, int)

	2:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public int getTranslateY() Gets the Y coordinate of the translated origin of this graphics context. Returns: Y of current origin

	3:	javax.microedition.lcdui.game.LayerManager public void paint(Graphics g, int x, int y) Renders the LayerManager's current view window at the specified location.

Parameters: g - the graphics instance with which to draw the LayerManager x - the horizontal location at which to render the view window, relative to the Graphics' translated origin y - the vertical location at which to render the view window, relative to the Graphics' translated origin Throws: NullPointerException - if g is null See Also: setViewWindow(int, int, int, int)

	4:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public void translate(int x, int y) Translates the origin of the graphics context to the point (x, y) in the current coordinate system.

	9:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public void copyArea(int x_src, int y_src, int width, int height, int x_dest, int y_dest, int anchor) Copies the contents of a rectangular area (x_src, y_src, width, height) to a destination area, whose anchor point identified by anchor is located at (x_dest, y_dest). The effect must be that the destination area contains an exact copy of the contents of the source area immediately prior to the invocation of this method.

getClipWidth
Gets the width of the current clipping area	0:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public int getClipWidth() Gets the width of the current clipping area. Returns: width of the current clipping area. See Also: clipRect(int, int, int, int), setClip(int, int, int, int)

	1:	android.graphics.Canvas public boolean quickReject (RectF rect, Canvas.EdgeType type) Return true if the specified rectangle, after being transformed by the current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and therefore you can skip making the draw calls). Parameters rect the rect to compare with the current clip type AA if the path should be considered antialiased, since that means it may affect a larger area (more pixels) than non-antialiased (BW). Returns true if the rect (transformed by the canvas' matrix) does not intersect with the canvas' clip
	2:	android.hardware.Camera.Parameters public List<Camera.Area> getFocusAreas () Gets the current focus areas. Camera driver uses the areas to decide focus. Before using this API or setFocusAreas(List), apps should call getMaxNumFocusAreas() to know the maximum number of focus areas first. If the value is 0, focus area is not supported. Each focus area is a rectangle with specified weight. The direction is relative to the sensor orientation, that is, what the sensor sees. The direction is not affected by the rotation or mirroring of setDisplayOrientation(int). Coordinates of the rectangle range from -1000 to 1000. (-1000, -1000) is the upper left point. (1000, 1000) is the lower right point. The width and height of focus areas cannot be 0 or negative. The weight must range from 1 to 1000. The weight should be interpreted as a per-pixel weight - all pixels in the area have the specified weight. This means a small area with the same weight as a larger area will have less influence on the focusing than the larger area. Focus areas can partially overlap and the driver will add the weights in the overlap region. A special case of a null focus area list means the driver is free to select focus targets as it wants. For example, the driver may use more signals to select focus areas and change them dynamically. Apps can set the focus area list to null if they want the driver to completely control focusing. Focus areas are relative to the current field of view (getZoom()). No matter what the zoom level is, (-1000,-1000) represents the top of the currently visible camera frame. The focus area cannot be set to be outside the current field of view, even when using zoom. Focus area only has effect if the current focus mode is FOCUS_MODE_AUTO, FOCUS_MODE_MACRO, FOCUS_MODE_CONTINUOUS_VIDEO, or FOCUS_MODE_CONTINUOUS_PICTURE. Returns a list of current focus areas
	3:	android.hardware.Camera.Parameters public List<Camera.Area> getMeteringAreas () Gets the current metering areas. Camera driver uses these areas to decide exposure. Before using this API or setMeteringAreas(List), apps should call getMaxNumMeteringAreas() to know the maximum number of metering areas first. If the value is 0, metering area is not supported. Each metering area is a rectangle with specified weight. The direction is relative to the sensor orientation, that is, what the sensor sees. The direction is not affected by the rotation or mirroring of setDisplayOrientation(int). Coordinates of the rectangle range from -1000 to 1000. (-1000, -1000) is the upper left point. (1000, 1000) is the lower right point. The width and height of metering areas cannot be 0 or negative. The weight must range from 1 to 1000, and represents a weight for every pixel in the area. This means that a large metering area with the same weight as a smaller area will have more effect in the metering result. Metering areas can partially overlap and the driver will add the weights in the overlap region. A special case of a null metering area list means the driver is free to meter as it chooses. For example, the driver may use more signals to select metering areas and change them dynamically. Apps can set the metering area list to null if they want the driver to completely control metering. Metering areas are relative to the current field of view (getZoom()). No matter what the zoom level is, (-1000,-1000) represents the top of the currently visible camera frame. The metering area cannot be set to be outside the current field of view, even when using zoom. No matter what metering areas are, the final exposure are compensated by setExposureCompensation(int). Returns a list of current metering areas
	4:	android.graphics.Canvas public boolean quickReject (Path path, Canvas.EdgeType type) Return true if the specified path, after being transformed by the current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and therefore you can skip making the draw calls). Note: for speed it may return false even if the path itself might not intersect the clip (i.e. the bounds of the path intersects, but the path does not). Parameters path The path to compare with the current clip type AA if the path should be considered antialiased, since that means it may affect a larger area (more pixels) than non-antialiased (BW). Returns true if the path (transformed by the canvas' matrix) does not intersect with the canvas' clip
	5:	android.graphics.Canvas public boolean quickReject (float left, float top, float right, float bottom, Canvas.EdgeType type) Return true if the specified rectangle, after being transformed by the current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and therefore you can skip making the draw calls). Parameters left The left side of the rectangle to compare with the current clip top The top of the rectangle to compare with the current clip right The right side of the rectangle to compare with the current clip bottom The bottom of the rectangle to compare with the current clip type AA if the path should be considered antialiased, since that means it may affect a larger area (more pixels) than non-antialiased (BW). Returns true if the rect (transformed by the canvas' matrix) does not intersect with the canvas' clip
	6:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public void clipRect(int x, int y, int width, int height) Intersects the current clip with the specified rectangle. The resulting clipping area is the intersection of the current clipping area and the specified rectangle. This method can only be used to make the current clip smaller. To set the current clip larger, use the setClip method. Rendering operations have no effect outside of the clipping area. Parameters: x - the x coordinate of the rectangle to intersect the clip with y - the y coordinate of the rectangle to intersect the clip with width - the width of the rectangle to intersect the clip with height - the height of the rectangle to intersect the clip with See Also: setClip(int, int, int, int)

fillArc
Fills a circular or elliptical arc covering the specified rectangle	0:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public void fillArc(int x, int y, int width, int height, int startAngle, int arcAngle) Fills a circular or elliptical arc covering the specified rectangle. The resulting arc begins at startAngle and extends for arcAngle degrees. Angles are interpreted such that 0 degrees is at the 3 o'clock position. A positive value indicates a counter-clockwise rotation while a negative value indicates a clockwise rotation. The center of the arc is the center of the rectangle whose origin is (x,y) and whose size is specified by the width and height arguments. If either width or height is zero or less, nothing is drawn. The filled region consists of the "pie wedge" region bounded by the arc segment as if drawn by drawArc(), the radius extending from the center to this arc at startAngle degrees, and radius extending from the center to this arc at startAngle + arcAngle degrees. The angles are specified relative to the non-square extents of the bounding rectangle such that 45 degrees always falls on the line from the center of the ellipse to the upper right corner of the bounding rectangle. As a result, if the bounding rectangle is noticeably longer in one axis than the other, the angles to the start and end of the arc segment will be skewed farther along the longer axis of the bounds. Parameters: x - the x coordinate of the upper-left corner of the arc to be filled. y - the y coordinate of the upper-left corner of the arc to be filled. width - the width of the arc to be filled height - the height of the arc to be filled startAngle - the beginning angle. arcAngle - the angular extent of the arc, relative to the start angle.

drawString
Draws the specified String using the current font and color	0:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public void drawString(String str, int x, int y, int anchor) Draws the specified String using the current font and color. The x,y position is the position of the anchor point. See anchor points. Parameters: str - the String to be drawn x - the x coordinate of the anchor point y - the y coordinate of the anchor point anchor - the anchor point for positioning the text Throws: NullPointerException - if str is null IllegalArgumentException - if anchor is not a legal value See Also: drawChars(char[], int, int, int, int, int)

	1:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public void drawString(String text, int x, int y, int anchor); (x,y)
(LEFT, HCENTER, RIGHT)
(TOP, BASELINE, BOTTOM)
OR
TOP | LEFT

Vertical centering of the text is not specified since it is not considered useful, it is hard to specify, and it is burdensome to implement. Thus, the VCENTER value is not allowed in the anchor point parameter of text drawing calls.
The actual position of the bounding box of the text relative to the (x, y) location is determined by the anchor point. These anchor points occur at named locations along the outer edge of the bounding box. Thus, if f is g's current font (as returned by g.getFont(), the following calls will all have identical results:
g.drawString(str, x, y, TOP|LEFT);
    g.drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str)/2, y, TOP|HCENTER);
    g.drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str), y, TOP|RIGHT);

    g.drawString(str, x,
        y + f.getBaselinePosition(), BASELINE|LEFT);
    g.drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str)/2,
        y + f.getBaselinePosition(), BASELINE|HCENTER);
    g.drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str),
        y + f.getBaselinePosition(), BASELINE|RIGHT);

    drawString(str, x,
        y + f.getHeight(), BOTTOM|LEFT);
    drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str)/2,
        y + f.getHeight(), BOTTOM|HCENTER);
    drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str),
        y + f.getHeight(), BOTTOM|RIGHT);
For text drawing, the inter-character and inter-line spacing (leading) specified by the font designer are included as part of the values returned in the stringWidth() and getHeight() calls of class Font. For example, given the following code:
// (5)
    g.drawString(string1+string2, x, y, TOP|LEFT);

    // (6)
    g.drawString(string1, x, y, TOP|LEFT);
    g.drawString(string2, x + f.stringWidth(string1), y, TOP|LEFT);

Code fragments (5) and (6) behave similarly if not identically. This occurs because f.stringWidth() includes the inter-character spacing. The exact spacing of may differ between these calls if the system supports font kerning.
Similarly, reasonable vertical spacing may be achieved simply by adding the font height to the Y-position of subsequent lines. For example:
g.drawString(string1, x, y, TOP|LEFT);
    g.drawString(string2, x, y + f.fontHeight(), TOP|LEFT);
draws string1 and string2 on separate lines with an appropriate amount of inter-line spacing.
The stringWidth() of the string and the fontHeight() of the font in which it is drawn define the size of the bounding box of a piece of text. As described above, this box includes inter-line and inter-character spacing. The implementation is required to put this space below and to right of the pixels actually belonging to the characters drawn. Applications that wish to position graphics closely with respect to text (for example, to paint a rectangle around a string of text) may assume that there is space below and to the right of a string and that there is no space above and to the left of the string.
Anchor points are also used for positioning of images. Similar to text drawing, the anchor point for an image specifies the point on the bounding rectangle of the destination that is to positioned at the (x,y) location given in the graphics request. Unlike text, vertical centering of images is well-defined, and thus the VCENTER value may be used within the anchor point parameter of image drawing requests. Because images have no notion of a baseline, the BASELINE value may not be used within the anchor point parameter of image drawing requests.

	7:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawVertices (Canvas.VertexMode mode, int vertexCount, float[] verts, int vertOffset, float[] texs, int texOffset, int[] colors, int colorOffset, short[] indices, int indexOffset, int indexCount, Paint paint) Draw the array of vertices, interpreted as triangles (based on mode). The verts array is required, and specifies the x,y pairs for each vertex. If texs is non-null, then it is used to specify the coordinate in shader coordinates to use at each vertex (the paint must have a shader in this case). If there is no texs array, but there is a color array, then each color is interpolated across its corresponding triangle in a gradient. If both texs and colors arrays are present, then they behave as before, but the resulting color at each pixels is the result of multiplying the colors from the shader and the color-gradient together. The indices array is optional, but if it is present, then it is used to specify the index of each triangle, rather than just walking through the arrays in order. Parameters mode How to interpret the array of vertices vertexCount The number of values in the vertices array (and corresponding texs and colors arrays if non-null). Each logical vertex is two values (x, y), vertexCount must be a multiple of 2. verts Array of vertices for the mesh vertOffset Number of values in the verts to skip before drawing. texs May be null. If not null, specifies the coordinates to sample into the current shader (e.g. bitmap tile or gradient) texOffset Number of values in texs to skip before drawing. colors May be null. If not null, specifies a color for each vertex, to be interpolated across the triangle. colorOffset Number of values in colors to skip before drawing. indices If not null, array of indices to reference into the vertex (texs, colors) array. indexCount number of entries in the indices array (if not null). paint Specifies the shader to use if the texs array is non-null.
	8:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawBitmap (int[] colors, int offset, int stride, float x, float y, int width, int height, boolean hasAlpha, Paint paint) Treat the specified array of colors as a bitmap, and draw it. This gives the same result as first creating a bitmap from the array, and then drawing it, but this method avoids explicitly creating a bitmap object which can be more efficient if the colors are changing often. Parameters colors Array of colors representing the pixels of the bitmap offset Offset into the array of colors for the first pixel stride The number of colors in the array between rows (must be >= width or <= -width). x The X coordinate for where to draw the bitmap y The Y coordinate for where to draw the bitmap width The width of the bitmap height The height of the bitmap hasAlpha True if the alpha channel of the colors contains valid values.

Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be the edge color replicated. If the bitmap and canvas have different densities, this function will take care of automatically scaling the bitmap to draw at the same density as the canvas. Parameters bitmap The bitmap to be drawn left The position of the left side of the bitmap being drawn top The position of the top side of the bitmap being drawn paint The paint used to draw the bitmap (may be null)

The destination, if it is an image, must not be the same image as the source image. If it is, an exception is thrown. This restriction is present in order to avoid ill-defined behaviors that might occur if overlapped, transformed copies were permitted. The transform function used must be one of the following, as defined in the Sprite class: Sprite.TRANS_NONE - causes the specified image region to be copied unchanged Sprite.TRANS_ROT90 - causes the specified image region to be rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. Sprite.TRANS_ROT180 - causes the specified image region to be rotated clockwise by 180 degrees. Sprite.TRANS_ROT270 - causes the specified image region to be rotated clockwise by 270 degrees.

If the source region contains transparent pixels, the corresponding pixels in the destination region must be left untouched. If the source region contains partially transparent pixels, a compositing operation must be performed with the destination pixels, leaving all pixels of the destination region fully opaque. The (x_src, y_src) coordinates are relative to the upper left corner of the source image. The x_src, y_src, width, and height parameters specify a rectangular region of the source image. It is illegal for this region to extend beyond the bounds of the source image. This requires that:

Each point is centered at the coordinate specified by pts[], and its diameter is specified by the paint's stroke width (as transformed by the canvas' CTM), with special treatment for a stroke width of 0, which always draws exactly 1 pixel (or at most 4 if antialiasing is enabled). The shape of the point is controlled by the paint's Cap type. The shape is a square, unless the cap type is Round, in which case the shape is a circle. Parameters pts Array of points to draw [x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2 ...] offset Number of values to skip before starting to draw. count The number of values to process, after skipping offset of them. Since one point uses two values, the number of "points" that are drawn is really (count >> 1). paint The paint used to draw the points
	8:	android.widget.ListPopupWindow public void setAnchorView (View anchor) Sets the popup's anchor view. This popup will always be positioned relative to the anchor view when shown. Parameters anchor The view to use as an anchor.

	1:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Image public static Image createImage(Image image, int x, int y, int width, int height, int transform) Creates an immutable image using pixel data from the specified region of a source image, transformed as specified. The source image may be mutable or immutable. For immutable source images, transparency information, if any, is copied to the new image unchanged. On some devices, pre-transformed images may render more quickly than images that are transformed on the fly using drawRegion. However, creating such images does consume additional heap space, so this technique should be applied only to images whose rendering speed is critical. The transform function used must be one of the following, as defined in the Sprite class: Sprite.TRANS_NONE - causes the specified image region to be copied unchanged Sprite.TRANS_ROT90 - causes the specified image region to be rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. Sprite.TRANS_ROT180 - causes the specified image region to be rotated clockwise by 180 degrees. Sprite.TRANS_ROT270 - causes the specified image region to be rotated clockwise by 270 degrees. Sprite.TRANS_MIRROR - causes the specified image region to be reflected about its vertical center. Sprite.TRANS_MIRROR_ROT90 - causes the specified image region to be reflected about its vertical center and then rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. Sprite.TRANS_MIRROR_ROT180 - causes the specified image region to be reflected about its vertical center and then rotated clockwise by 180 degrees. Sprite.TRANS_MIRROR_ROT270 - causes the specified image region to be reflected about its vertical center and then rotated clockwise by 270 degrees. The size of the returned image will be the size of the specified region with the transform applied. For example, if the region is 100x50 pixels and the transform is TRANS_ROT90, the returned image will be 50x100 pixels. Note: If all of the following conditions are met, this method may simply return the source Image without creating a new one: the source image is immutable; the region represents the entire source image; and the transform is TRANS_NONE. Parameters: image - the source image to be copied from x - the horizontal location of the region to be copied y - the vertical location of the region to be copied width - the width of the region to be copied height - the height of the region to be copied transform - the transform to be applied to the region Returns: the new, immutable image Throws: NullPointerException - if image is null IllegalArgumentException - if the region to be copied exceeds the bounds of the source image IllegalArgumentException - if either width or height is zero or less IllegalArgumentException - if the transform is not valid Since: MIDP 2.0

	2:	javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory public abstract Transformer newTransformer () Create a new Transformer that performs a copy of the Source to the Result. i.e. the "identity transform". Returns A Transformer object that may be used to perform a transformation in a single thread, never null. Throws TransformerConfigurationException Thrown if it is not possible to create a Transformer instance.
	3:	android.graphics.SurfaceTexture public void getTransformMatrix (float[] mtx) Retrieve the 4x4 texture coordinate transform matrix associated with the texture image set by the most recent call to updateTexImage. This transform matrix maps 2D homogeneous texture coordinates of the form (s, t, 0, 1) with s and t in the inclusive range [0, 1] to the texture coordinate that should be used to sample that location from the texture. Sampling the texture outside of the range of this transform is undefined. The matrix is stored in column-major order so that it may be passed directly to OpenGL ES via the glLoadMatrixf or glUniformMatrix4fv functions. Parameters mtx the array into which the 4x4 matrix will be stored. The array must have exactly 16 elements.
	4:	android.graphics.BitmapRegionDecoder public Bitmap decodeRegion (Rect rect, BitmapFactory.Options options) Decodes a rectangle region in the image specified by rect. Parameters rect The rectangle that specified the region to be decode. options null-ok; Options that control downsampling. inPurgeable is not supported. Returns The decoded bitmap, or null if the image data could not be decoded.
	5:	javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory public abstract Transformer newTransformer (Source source) Process the Source into a Transformer Object. The Source is an XSLT document that conforms to XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 1.0. Care must be taken not to use this Transformer in multiple Threads running concurrently. Different TransformerFactories can be used concurrently by different Threads. Parameters source Source of XSLT document used to create Transformer. Examples of XML Sources include StreamSource, SAXSource and DOMSource. Returns A Transformer object that may be used to perform a transformation in a single Thread, never null. Throws TransformerConfigurationException Thrown if there are errors when parsing the Source or it is not possible to create a Transformer instance. See Also XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 1.0
	6:	android.graphics.ColorMatrixColorFilter public ColorMatrixColorFilter (ColorMatrix matrix) Create a colorfilter that transforms colors through a 4x5 color matrix. Parameters matrix 4x5 matrix used to transform colors. It is copied into the filter, so changes made to the matrix after the filter is constructed will not be reflected in the filter.
	7:	android.graphics.BitmapRegionDecoder public static BitmapRegionDecoder newInstance (FileDescriptor fd, boolean isShareable) Create a BitmapRegionDecoder from the file descriptor. The position within the descriptor will not be changed when this returns, so the descriptor can be used again as is. Currently only the JPEG and PNG formats are supported. Parameters fd The file descriptor containing the data to decode isShareable If this is true, then the BitmapRegionDecoder may keep a shallow reference to the input. If this is false, then the BitmapRegionDecoder will explicitly make a copy of the input data, and keep that. Even if sharing is allowed, the implementation may still decide to make a deep copy of the input data. If an image is progressively encoded, allowing sharing may degrade the decoding speed. Returns BitmapRegionDecoder, or null if the image data could not be decoded. Throws IOException if the image format is not supported or can not be decoded.
	8:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public void copyArea(int x_src, int y_src, int width, int height, int x_dest, int y_dest, int anchor) Copies the contents of a rectangular area (x_src, y_src, width, height) to a destination area, whose anchor point identified by anchor is located at (x_dest, y_dest). The effect must be that the destination area contains an exact copy of the contents of the source area immediately prior to the invocation of this method. This result must occur even if the source and destination areas overlap. The points (x_src, y_src) and (x_dest, y_dest) are both specified relative to the coordinate system of the Graphics object. It is illegal for the source region to extend beyond the bounds of the graphic object. This requires that: 
   x_src + tx >= 0
   y_src + ty >= 0
   x_src + tx + width <= width of Graphics object's destination
   y_src + ty + height <= height of Graphics object's destination      where tx and ty represent the X and Y coordinates of the translated origin of this graphics object, as returned by getTranslateX() and getTranslateY(), respectively. However, it is legal for the destination area to extend beyond the bounds of the Graphics object. Pixels outside of the bounds of the Graphics object will not be drawn. The copyArea method is allowed on all Graphics objects except those whose destination is the actual display device. This restriction is necessary because allowing a copyArea method on the display would adversely impact certain techniques for implementing double-buffering. Like other graphics operations, the copyArea method uses the Source Over Destination rule for combining pixels. However, since it is defined only for mutable images, which can contain only fully opaque pixels, this is effectively the same as pixel replacement. Parameters: x_src - the x coordinate of upper left corner of source area y_src - the y coordinate of upper left corner of source area width - the width of the source area height - the height of the source area x_dest - the x coordinate of the destination anchor point y_dest - the y coordinate of the destination anchor point anchor - the anchor point for positioning the region within the destination image Throws: IllegalStateException - if the destination of this Graphics object is the display device IllegalArgumentException - if the region to be copied exceeds the bounds of the source image Since: MIDP 2.0

	9:	javax.microedition.lcdui.game.Sprite public void setTransform(int transform) Sets the transform for this Sprite. Transforms can be applied to a Sprite to change its rendered appearance. Transforms are applied to the original Sprite image; they are not cumulative, nor can they be combined. By default, a Sprite's transform is TRANS_NONE. Since some transforms involve rotations of 90 or 270 degrees, their use may result in the overall width and height of the Sprite being swapped. As a result, the values returned by Layer.getWidth() and Layer.getHeight() may change. The collision rectangle is also modified by the transform so that it remains static relative to the pixel data of the Sprite. Similarly, the defined reference pixel is unchanged by this method, but its visual location within the Sprite may change as a result. This method repositions the Sprite so that the location of the reference pixel in the painter's coordinate system does not change as a result of changing the transform. Thus, the reference pixel effectively becomes the centerpoint for the transform. Consequently, the values returned by getRefPixelX() and getRefPixelY() will be the same both before and after the transform is applied, but the values returned by getX() and getY() may change. Parameters: transform - the desired transform for this Sprite Throws: IllegalArgumentException - if the requested transform is invalid See Also: TRANS_NONE, TRANS_ROT90, TRANS_ROT180, TRANS_ROT270, TRANS_MIRROR, TRANS_MIRROR_ROT90, TRANS_MIRROR_ROT180, TRANS_MIRROR_ROT270

The effect must be that the destination area contains an exact copy of the contents of the source area immediately prior to the invocation of this method. This result must occur even if the source and destination areas overlap. The points (x_src, y_src) and (x_dest, y_dest) are both specified relative to the coordinate system of the Graphics object. It is illegal for the source region to extend beyond the bounds of the graphic object. This requires that: 
   x_src + tx >= 0
   y_src + ty >= 0
   x_src + tx + width <= width of Graphics object's destination
   y_src + ty + height <= height of Graphics object's destination      where tx and ty represent the X and Y coordinates of the translated origin of this graphics object, as returned by getTranslateX() and getTranslateY(), respectively. However, it is legal for the destination area to extend beyond the bounds of the Graphics object. Pixels outside of the bounds of the Graphics object will not be drawn.

Parameters: x_src - the x coordinate of upper left corner of source area y_src - the y coordinate of upper left corner of source area width - the width of the source area height - the height of the source area x_dest - the x coordinate of the destination anchor point y_dest - the y coordinate of the destination anchor point anchor - the anchor point for positioning the region within the destination image Throws: IllegalStateException - if the destination of this Graphics object is the display device IllegalArgumentException - if the region to be copied exceeds the bounds of the source image Since: MIDP 2.0

	1:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public void drawRegion(Image src, int x_src, int y_src, int width, int height, int transform, int x_dest, int y_dest, int anchor) Copies a region of the specified source image to a location within the destination, possibly transforming (rotating and reflecting) the image data using the chosen transform function. The destination, if it is an image, must not be the same image as the source image. If it is, an exception is thrown. This restriction is present in order to avoid ill-defined behaviors that might occur if overlapped, transformed copies were permitted. The transform function used must be one of the following, as defined in the Sprite class: Sprite.TRANS_NONE - causes the specified image region to be copied unchanged Sprite.TRANS_ROT90 - causes the specified image region to be rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. Sprite.TRANS_ROT180 - causes the specified image region to be rotated clockwise by 180 degrees. Sprite.TRANS_ROT270 - causes the specified image region to be rotated clockwise by 270 degrees. Sprite.TRANS_MIRROR - causes the specified image region to be reflected about its vertical center. Sprite.TRANS_MIRROR_ROT90 - causes the specified image region to be reflected about its vertical center and then rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. Sprite.TRANS_MIRROR_ROT180 - causes the specified image region to be reflected about its vertical center and then rotated clockwise by 180 degrees. Sprite.TRANS_MIRROR_ROT270 - causes the specified image region to be reflected about its vertical center and then rotated clockwise by 270 degrees. If the source region contains transparent pixels, the corresponding pixels in the destination region must be left untouched. If the source region contains partially transparent pixels, a compositing operation must be performed with the destination pixels, leaving all pixels of the destination region fully opaque. The (x_src, y_src) coordinates are relative to the upper left corner of the source image. The x_src, y_src, width, and height parameters specify a rectangular region of the source image. It is illegal for this region to extend beyond the bounds of the source image. This requires that: 
   x_src >= 0
   y_src >= 0
   x_src + width <= source width
   y_src + height <= source height    The (x_dest, y_dest) coordinates are relative to the coordinate system of this Graphics object. It is legal for the destination area to extend beyond the bounds of the Graphics object. Pixels outside of the bounds of the Graphics object will not be drawn. The transform is applied to the image data from the region of the source image, and the result is rendered with its anchor point positioned at location (x_dest, y_dest) in the destination. Parameters: src - the source image to copy from x_src - the x coordinate of the upper left corner of the region within the source image to copy y_src - the y coordinate of the upper left corner of the region within the source image to copy width - the width of the region to copy height - the height of the region to copy transform - the desired transformation for the selected region being copied x_dest - the x coordinate of the anchor point in the destination drawing area y_dest - the y coordinate of the anchor point in the destination drawing area anchor - the anchor point for positioning the region within the destination image Throws: IllegalArgumentException - if src is the same image as the destination of this Graphics object NullPointerException - if src is null IllegalArgumentException - if transform is invalid IllegalArgumentException - if anchor is invalid IllegalArgumentException - if the region to be copied exceeds the bounds of the source image Since: MIDP 2.0

	2:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public void drawImage(Image img, int x, int y, int anchor) Draws the specified image by using the anchor point. The image can be drawn in different positions relative to the anchor point by passing the appropriate position constants. See anchor points. If the source image contains transparent pixels, the corresponding pixels in the destination image must be left untouched. If the source image contains partially transparent pixels, a compositing operation must be performed with the destination pixels, leaving all pixels of the destination image fully opaque. If img is the same as the destination of this Graphics object, the result is undefined. For copying areas within an Image, copyArea should be used instead. Parameters: img - the specified image to be drawn x - the x coordinate of the anchor point y - the y coordinate of the anchor point anchor - the anchor point for positioning the image Throws: IllegalArgumentException - if anchor is not a legal value NullPointerException - if img is null See Also: Image

	3:	android.widget.PopupWindow public void update (View anchor, int xoff, int yoff, int width, int height) Updates the position and the dimension of the popup window. Width and height can be set to -1 to update location only. Calling this function also updates the window with the current popup state as described for update(). If the view later scrolls to move anchor to a different location, the popup will be moved correspondingly. Parameters anchor the popup's anchor view xoff x offset from the view's left edge yoff y offset from the view's bottom edge width the new width, can be -1 to ignore height the new height, can be -1 to ignore
	4:	android.widget.PopupWindow public void showAsDropDown (View anchor, int xoff, int yoff) Display the content view in a popup window anchored to the bottom-left corner of the anchor view offset by the specified x and y coordinates. If there is not enough room on screen to show the popup in its entirety, this method tries to find a parent scroll view to scroll. If no parent scroll view can be scrolled, the bottom-left corner of the popup is pinned at the top left corner of the anchor view. If the view later scrolls to move anchor to a different location, the popup will be moved correspondingly. Parameters anchor the view on which to pin the popup window See Also dismiss()
	5:	android.telephony.gsm.GsmCellLocation public void setLacAndCid (int lac, int cid) Set the location area code and the cell id.
	6:	javax.microedition.lcdui.CustomItem protected final void repaint(int x, int y, int w, int h) Called by subclass code to request that the specified rectangular area of the item be repainted. If that area is visible on the display, this will result in call to paint with graphics set to include the specified rectangular area. The area is specified relative to the CustomItem's content area. The CustomItem should call this method when the item's internal state has been updated and only part of the visual representation needs to be updated. Parameters: x - the x coordinate of the rectangular area to be updated y - the y coordinate of the rectangular area to be updated w - the width of the rectangular area to be updated h - the height of the rectangular area to be updated

fillTriangle
Fills the specified triangle will the current color	0:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public void fillTriangle(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, int x3, int y3) Fills the specified triangle will the current color. The lines connecting each pair of points are included in the filled triangle. Parameters: x1 - the x coordinate of the first vertex of the triangle y1 - the y coordinate of the first vertex of the triangle x2 - the x coordinate of the second vertex of the triangle y2 - the y coordinate of the second vertex of the triangle x3 - the x coordinate of the third vertex of the triangle y3 - the y coordinate of the third vertex of the triangle Since: MIDP 2.0

	1:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawColor (int color) Fill the entire canvas' bitmap (restricted to the current clip) with the specified color, using srcover porterduff mode. Parameters color the color to draw onto the canvas
	2:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawColor (int color, PorterDuff.Mode mode) Fill the entire canvas' bitmap (restricted to the current clip) with the specified color and porter-duff xfermode. Parameters color the color to draw with mode the porter-duff mode to apply to the color
	3:	android.graphics.Canvas public void drawVertices (Canvas.VertexMode mode, int vertexCount, float[] verts, int vertOffset, float[] texs, int texOffset, int[] colors, int colorOffset, short[] indices, int indexOffset, int indexCount, Paint paint) Draw the array of vertices, interpreted as triangles (based on mode). The verts array is required, and specifies the x,y pairs for each vertex. If texs is non-null, then it is used to specify the coordinate in shader coordinates to use at each vertex (the paint must have a shader in this case). If there is no texs array, but there is a color array, then each color is interpolated across its corresponding triangle in a gradient. If both texs and colors arrays are present, then they behave as before, but the resulting color at each pixels is the result of multiplying the colors from the shader and the color-gradient together. The indices array is optional, but if it is present, then it is used to specify the index of each triangle, rather than just walking through the arrays in order. Parameters mode How to interpret the array of vertices vertexCount The number of values in the vertices array (and corresponding texs and colors arrays if non-null). Each logical vertex is two values (x, y), vertexCount must be a multiple of 2. verts Array of vertices for the mesh vertOffset Number of values in the verts to skip before drawing. texs May be null. If not null, specifies the coordinates to sample into the current shader (e.g. bitmap tile or gradient) texOffset Number of values in texs to skip before drawing. colors May be null. If not null, specifies a color for each vertex, to be interpolated across the triangle. colorOffset Number of values in colors to skip before drawing. indices If not null, array of indices to reference into the vertex (texs, colors) array. indexCount number of entries in the indices array (if not null). paint Specifies the shader to use if the texs array is non-null.

drawRGB
Renders a series of device-independent RGB+transparency values in a specified region	0:	javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics public void drawRGB(int[] rgbData, int offset, int scanlength, int x, int y, int width, int height, boolean processAlpha) Renders a series of device-independent RGB+transparency values in a specified region. The values are stored in rgbData in a format with 24 bits of RGB and an eight-bit alpha value (0xAARRGGBB), with the first value stored at the specified offset. The scanlength specifies the relative offset within the array between the corresponding pixels of consecutive rows. Any value for scanlength is acceptable (even negative values) provided that all resulting references are within the bounds of the rgbData array. The ARGB data is rasterized horizontally from left to right within each row. The ARGB values are rendered in the region specified by x, y, width and height, and the operation is subject to the current clip region and translation for this Graphics object. Consider P(a,b) to be the value of the pixel located at column a and row b of the Image, where rows and columns are numbered downward from the top starting at zero, and columns are numbered rightward from the left starting at zero. This operation can then be defined as: 
    P(a, b) = rgbData[offset + (a - x) + (b - y) * scanlength]       for 
     x <= a < x + width
     y <= b < y + height    This capability is provided in the Graphics class so that it can be used to render both to the screen and to offscreen Image objects. The ability to retrieve ARGB values is provided by the Image.getRGB(int[], int, int, int, int, int, int) method. If processAlpha is true, the high-order byte of the ARGB format specifies opacity; that is, 0x00RRGGBB specifies a fully transparent pixel and 0xFFRRGGBB specifies a fully opaque pixel. Intermediate alpha values specify semitransparency. If the implementation does not support alpha blending for image rendering operations, it must remove any semitransparency from the source data prior to performing any rendering. (See Alpha Processing for further discussion.) If processAlpha is false, the alpha values are ignored and all pixels must be treated as completely opaque. The mapping from ARGB values to the device-dependent pixels is platform-specific and may require significant computation. Parameters: rgbData - an array of ARGB values in the format 0xAARRGGBB offset - the array index of the first ARGB value scanlength - the relative array offset between the corresponding pixels in consecutive rows in the rgbData array x - the horizontal location of the region to be rendered y - the vertical location of the region to be rendered width - the width of the region to be rendered height - the height of the region to be rendered processAlpha - true if rgbData has an alpha channel, false if all pixels are fully opaque Throws: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException - if the requested operation will attempt to access an element of rgbData whose index is either negative or beyond its length NullPointerException - if rgbData is null Since: MIDP 2.0
